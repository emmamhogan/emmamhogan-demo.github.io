title: Why You Should Avoid Amazon
---

    
Amazon takes away from small businesses that do not have the means to lower their prices as substantially. The low prices that customers can often find on Amazon,
and on many other fast fashion websites, is a result of worker exploitation, or not paying workers a living wage. Amazon is also guilty of utilizing excessive waste 
in shipping almost all of its product. They ship around 165 billion cardboard boxes a year which equates to 1 billion trees.
